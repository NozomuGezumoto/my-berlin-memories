Privacy Policy

My Berlin Memories

Last updated: February 2026

My Berlin Memories ("the App") respects your privacy and complies with applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

1. Data We Collect
Personal Data

The App does not require account registration and does not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or contact details.

User Content

Notes, rankings, categories, and memory entries created within the App are stored locally on your device.
We do not access, collect, or transmit this data to external servers.

Location Data

The App allows users to manually select locations or use their current location.
Location data is used only to display map functionality within the App and is not stored on external servers.

2. Data Processing and Legal Basis (GDPR)

Because the App does not collect or store personal data on external servers, no personal data processing occurs beyond what is required for the App to function locally on your device.

If map services (e.g., Apple MapKit) are used, such services may process data according to their own privacy policies.

3. Data Storage

All memory data is stored locally on your device.
Deleting the App may permanently delete all stored data.

The developer does not maintain external databases containing user data.

4. Third-Party Services

The App may use:

Apple MapKit

Apple system services

These providers may process technical data according to their own privacy policies.

Please refer to Apple's Privacy Policy for further details.

5. Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or share user data with third parties.

6. Your Rights Under GDPR

Under the GDPR, users in the European Union have the right to:

Access their personal data

Request correction or deletion

Restrict or object to processing

However, since the App does not store personal data externally, most rights can be exercised directly by deleting data from your device or uninstalling the App.

7. Children's Privacy

The App is not directed toward children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
The "Last updated" date will reflect any changes.
